__Apple has issued critical security patches for iOS devices and for Macintosh computers to thwart a potential hacker attack that could come remotely via Wi-Fi.__


The dangerous vulnerability, called Broadpwn, had been exposed by a security researcher Nitay Artenstein of Exodus Intelligence, who indicated that a malicious hacker could compromise devices through a bug within Broadcom Wi-Fi chipsets.
As long as the attacker is within range, he or she may be able to execute arbitrary code on the Wi-Fi chip.

Broadpwn is indeed a potentially a serious threat. According to the National Vulnerability Database that is part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST, Broadpwn gets a 9.8 out of 10, a severity scored dubbed "critical".

The vulnerability also had the potential to attack Android devices; Google issued its own security patch earlier this month.
